# Team Communication Guidelines

Effective communication is essential for the success of our  
group project. These guidelines provide a framework for  
maintaining clear, professional, and collaborative communication  
within the team.

## 1. Communication Tools

We will use the following platforms for specific types of  
communication:  
- **Slack**: For casual updates and quick team interactions.  
- **GitHub**: For all project-related discussions, code reviews,  
  and issue tracking.  
- **WhatsApp**: For urgent or necessary team coordination.  
- **Email**: For formal communication, announcements, and  
  documentation.  

## 2. Response Times

- Respond to asynchronous messages (Slack, GitHub, WhatsApp)  
  within **24 hours**.  
- Notify the team in advance if you anticipate delays in  
  responding.  

## 3. Communication Best Practices

- Use clear and concise language in all messages.  
- Stick to agreed-upon channels for specific types of  
  communication.  
- Ensure all shared files, documents, and notes are organized  
  in an accessible online drive (e.g., **Google Drive**).  

## 4. Meeting and Collaboration Etiquette

- Attend scheduled meetings punctually and prepared.  
- Share agendas for meetings in advance and document key  
  decisions and action items.  
- Foster a respectful and inclusive environment during  
  discussions.  

## 5. Documentation and File Management

- Maintain a well-structured and up-to-date repository of  
  shared resources.  
- Archive completed tasks and communication records to preserve  
  project history.  

## 6. Periodic Reviews

- Conduct regular reviews of our communication tools and  
  processes.  
- Adjust strategies as needed to improve efficiency and team  
  collaboration.  

By following these guidelines, we ensure a professional,  
collaborative, and productive environment for achieving our  
project goals.
