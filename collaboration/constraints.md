# Team Nexus Constraints

Our team acknowledges that constraints are an inherent part of collaborative projects. These constraints may include time limitations, varying skill levels, resource availability, and external commitments. To ensure the success of our project, we will openly communicate about any constraints that may impact our individual contributions or the team's overall progress. By fostering transparency and understanding, we aim to create an environment where each member feels supported and valued.

Time management will be a critical focus for our team. We will prioritize setting realistic goals, defining clear deadlines, and consistently reviewing progress. Each member will commit to attending scheduled meetings, contributing to discussions, and completing assigned tasks on time. If challenges arise, we will approach them collaboratively, seeking solutions that align with our shared objectives while respecting individual boundaries. Through effective communication, adaptability, and mutual respect, we will overcome constraints and achieve our goals as a unified team.
