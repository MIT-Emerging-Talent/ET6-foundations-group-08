### [x] Code Review

**What it is:**  
Code review examines written code to identify bugs, enforce  
standards, and improve quality before merging it into the  
main codebase.

**How it’s used:**  
Teams review code through tools integrated into platforms  
like GitHub. Comments and approvals are shared in pull requests.

**Collaboration challenges addressed:**  
Code reviews promote knowledge sharing and collective  
ownership. They ensure alignment with standards and help  
improve the skills of contributors.

---

### [x] Project Boards

**What it is:**  
Project boards are visual tools to organize and manage tasks.  
Platforms like GitHub use them to track issues and pull requests.

**How it’s used:**  
Teams create columns for workflow stages (e.g., “To Do,”  
“Doing,” “Done”). Tasks move across columns as they progress.

**Collaboration challenges addressed:**  
Boards provide a clear overview of project status, help teams  
stay organized, and ensure everyone understands priorities.

### Command Line Interface / Terminal

**What it is:**  
The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used  
to interact with a computer’s operating system or software  
applications. It allows users to execute commands by typing them,  
rather than using a graphical interface.

**How it’s used:**  
Developers use the CLI to navigate file systems, execute scripts,  
and manage tools like Git. For instance, commands like `git clone`,  
`git commit`, and `git push` allow users to manage version  
control directly from the terminal. The CLI is also essential for  
configuring environments, automating tasks, and accessing server  
systems.

**Collaboration challenges addressed:**  
The CLI enables efficient and precise execution of tasks, reducing  
dependency on graphical tools. This consistency in commands and  
workflows ensures all team members can replicate processes,  
troubleshoot effectively, and work seamlessly across environments.
